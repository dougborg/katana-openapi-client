# MCP Server Deployment Guide

This document describes how the Katana MCP Server is released and published to PyPI
using **automated semantic-release**.

## Overview

Releases are **fully automated** using monorepo semantic-release. You don't manually
update version numbers or publish to PyPI - the CI/CD pipeline handles everything based
on conventional commits.

## How Releases Work

### Automated Release Process

When a PR is merged to `main` with MCP-related changes:

1. **CI Tests Run**: All quality checks, tests, and security scans must pass
1. **Semantic-Release Analysis**: Analyzes commits with `(mcp)` scope since last release
1. **Version Calculation**: Determines next version based on commit types:
   - `feat(mcp):` → MINOR bump (0.1.0 → 0.2.0)
   - `fix(mcp):` → PATCH bump (0.1.0 → 0.1.1)
   - `feat(mcp)!:` → MAJOR bump (0.1.0 → 1.0.0)
1. **Automatic Updates**:
   - Version updated in `pyproject.toml`
   - Changelog generated/updated
   - Git commit and tag created (`mcp-v{version}`)
   - Changes pushed to main
1. **Build and Publish**:
   - Package built with `uv build`
   - Published to PyPI using Trusted Publisher (OIDC, no tokens)
   - GitHub release created with auto-generated notes

## For Developers

### How to Trigger a Release

**Just write good commit messages with the `(mcp)` scope:**

```bash
# Feature (minor version bump)
git commit -m "feat(mcp): add search_products tool"

# Bug fix (patch version bump)
git commit -m "fix(mcp): correct stock level calculation"

# Breaking change (major version bump)
git commit -m "feat(mcp)!: redesign tool request models

BREAKING CHANGE: Tool request parameters now require explicit types"

# No release (documentation only)
git commit -m "docs(mcp): update README examples"
```

**That's it!** Merge your PR and the release happens automatically.

### Which Commits Trigger Releases?

| Commit Type   | Example                    | Release? | Version Bump        |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| `feat(mcp):`  | Add inventory tool         | ✅       | MINOR (0.1.0→0.2.0) |
| `fix(mcp):`   | Fix auth error             | ✅       | PATCH (0.1.0→0.1.1) |
| `perf(mcp):`  | Optimize query performance | ✅       | PATCH (0.1.0→0.1.1) |
| `feat(mcp)!:` | Breaking API change        | ✅       | MAJOR (0.1.0→1.0.0) |
| `docs(mcp):`  | Update documentation       | ❌       | No release          |
| `test(mcp):`  | Add unit tests             | ❌       | No release          |
| `chore(mcp):` | Update dependencies        | ❌       | No release          |
| `feat:` (no   | Feature without scope      | ❌       | Releases client     |
| scope)        |                            |          | instead             |

**IMPORTANT**: Always use the `(mcp)` scope for MCP server changes! Without it, the
client package will be released instead.

## Verify a Release

After a release is published (check
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dougborg/katana-openapi-client/releases)):

### 1. Check PyPI Page

Visit: https://pypi.org/project/katana-mcp-server/

Verify:

- ✅ New version is listed
- ✅ README renders correctly
- ✅ Project metadata is correct
- ✅ Installation command works

### 2. Test Installation from PyPI

```bash
# Create fresh test environment
cd /tmp
python3 -m venv test-pypi-install
source test-pypi-install/bin/activate

# Install from PyPI
pip install katana-mcp-server

# Verify installation
pip list | grep katana

# Test command (should require API key)
katana-mcp-server
# Expected: "KATANA_API_KEY environment variable is required"

# Clean up
deactivate
rm -rf /tmp/test-pypi-install
```

### 3. Test with Claude Desktop

Update Claude Desktop config
(`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "katana": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["katana-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "KATANA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop and verify:

- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ Inventory tools appear in MCP tools list
- ✅ Tools work when invoked

## Manual Testing Before Release

Before merging a PR that will trigger a release, test locally:

### Run All Tests

```bash
cd katana_mcp_server

# Unit tests (fast)
uv run pytest tests/ -m "not integration"

# Integration tests (requires KATANA_API_KEY in .env)
uv run pytest tests/ -m integration

# All tests
uv run pytest tests/
```

### Test Local Build

```bash
cd katana_mcp_server

# Build package
uv build

# Install locally (in a test venv)
cd /tmp
python3 -m venv test-local
source test-local/bin/activate
pip install /path/to/katana-openapi-client/katana_mcp_server/dist/*.whl

# Test
katana-mcp-server --help

# Clean up
deactivate
rm -rf /tmp/test-local
```

## Emergency Manual Release

If the automated workflow fails, you can trigger a manual release:

### Option 1: Re-run GitHub Workflow

```bash
# Re-run the most recent workflow
gh workflow run release.yml

# Or check workflow runs and re-run a specific one
gh run list --workflow=release.yml
gh run rerun <run-id> --failed
```

### Option 2: Manual Tag (Last Resort)

Only use if semantic-release is completely broken:

```bash
# WARNING: This bypasses semantic-release and version management!
# Only use in emergencies after coordinating with maintainers

# Manually update version in pyproject.toml first
# Then create and push tag
git tag mcp-v0.1.0
git push origin mcp-v0.1.0

# This triggers the backup release-mcp.yml workflow
```

**Note**: Manual tags bypass changelog generation and version file updates. Use
sparingly.

## Troubleshooting

### Release Not Triggered

**Symptom**: PR merged but no release created

**Causes**:

1. No `feat(mcp):` or `fix(mcp):` commits since last release
1. Forgot the `(mcp)` scope - released client instead
1. CI tests failed - release only runs after tests pass

**Solutions**:

- Check commit messages: `git log --oneline main`
- Verify scope is present: `git log --grep="(mcp)" main`
- Check GitHub Actions for failures

### Wrong Package Released

**Symptom**: Client package released instead of MCP server

**Cause**: Missing `(mcp)` scope in commit message

**Solution**: Use `feat(mcp):` or `fix(mcp):` for all MCP changes

### PyPI Publish Failed

**Symptom**: Release created but PyPI publish failed

**Causes**:

1. PyPI Trusted Publisher misconfigured
1. Version already exists on PyPI (can't overwrite)
1. PyPI service outage

**Solutions**:

1. Check PyPI Trusted Publisher configuration (no environment, correct repo/workflow)
1. Check if version exists: https://pypi.org/project/katana-mcp-server/#history
1. Check PyPI status: https://status.python.org/
1. Re-run the workflow: `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed`

### Tests Failed in CI

**Symptom**: PR checks failing, blocking release

**Solutions**:

1. Run tests locally: `uv run pytest tests/`
1. Check test output in GitHub Actions
1. Fix the issue and push new commit
1. Ensure commit uses `(mcp)` scope for release

### Version Conflict

**Symptom**: "Version X.Y.Z already exists on PyPI"

**Cause**: PyPI doesn't allow re-uploading the same version

**Solutions**:

1. This shouldn't happen with semantic-release (it always increments)
1. If it does, check if someone manually published that version
1. Force next version with additional commit: `fix(mcp): force version bump`

## Release Workflow Details

### Semantic-Release Configuration

Located in `katana_mcp_server/pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.semantic_release]
version_toml = ["katana_mcp_server/pyproject.toml:project.version"]
tag_format = "mcp-v{version}"
commit_message = "chore(release): mcp v{version}"
build_command = "cd katana_mcp_server && uv build"
# Only processes commits with (mcp) scope
```

### GitHub Workflow

Located in `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

- **Trigger**: Every push to `main` branch
- **Jobs**:
  1. `test` - Runs full CI pipeline
  1. `release-mcp` - Semantic-release for MCP server
  1. `publish-mcp-pypi` - Publishes to PyPI if released

### PyPI Trusted Publisher

Configured at: https://pypi.org/manage/project/katana-mcp-server/settings/publishing/

- **Owner**: `dougborg`
- **Repository**: `katana-openapi-client`
- **Workflow**: `release.yml`
- **Job**: `publish-mcp-pypi`
- **Environment**: (none)

## Version Numbering

This project uses semantic versioning with pre-release identifiers:

### Version Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-prerelease]`

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (`feat(mcp)!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:`)
- **MINOR**: New features (`feat(mcp):`)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (`fix(mcp):`, `perf(mcp):`)

### Pre-release Phases:

- **Alpha** (0.1.0a1, 0.1.0a2): Early development, unstable, breaking changes expected
- **Beta** (0.1.0b1): Feature complete, testing, API stabilizing
- **RC** (0.1.0rc1): Release candidate, final testing
- **Stable** (0.1.0, 1.0.0): Production-ready release

**Current Phase**: Alpha - API may change between versions

### Example Version Progression:

```
0.1.0a1  (first alpha - inventory tools)
  ↓ feat(mcp): add search
0.2.0a1  (new feature added)
  ↓ fix(mcp): auth error
0.2.1a1  (bug fix)
  ↓ feat(mcp): sales orders
0.3.0a1  (new feature)
  ↓ ready for beta
0.3.0b1  (beta testing)
  ↓ fix(mcp): critical bug
0.3.1b1  (bug fix in beta)
  ↓ ready for release
0.3.1    (stable release)
```
