# Recipe

A product recipe (sometimes also called bill-of-materials or simply BOM) is a list of
ingredients (materials and subassemblies) and the quantities you use in order to create
your product. Recipes can be created for products and their variations. You can create a
specific recipe for each product variant. ðŸš§ Recipe endpoints are deprecated in favour of
