            that will be used to generate the X-Sha2-Signature header for webhook
            event verification. When events are sent to your webhook endpoint,
            they will include X-Sha2-Signature and potentially X-Katana-Retry-Num headers.

                          Different operation types allows you to use different cost
                          calculations depending on the type of product operation
                          Process: The process operation type is best for when products
                          are individually built and time is the main driver of cost.
                          Setup: The setup operation type is best for setting up a
                          machine for production where the production quantity doesn't
                          affect cost.
                          Per unit: The per unit operation type is best when cost of
                          time isn't a factor, but only the quantity of product made.
                          Fixed cost: The fixed cost operation type is useful for adding
                          the expected extra costs that go into producing a product.
