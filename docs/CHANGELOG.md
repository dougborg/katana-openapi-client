# CHANGELOG


## v0.2.0 (2025-07-21)

### Breaking

- feat: eliminate confusing client.client pattern - cleaner API design (#5)

BREAKING CHANGE: KatanaClient now inherits directly from AuthenticatedClient instead of
wrapping it.

This significantly improves API ergonomics by eliminating the confusing
'client=client.client' pattern. Users can now pass KatanaClient directly to API methods:
'client=client'.

Changes:

- Make KatanaClient inherit from AuthenticatedClient
- Remove .client property - users pass KatanaClient directly
- Add py.typed file for PEP 561 type information distribution
- Update all documentation and examples to use clean API
- Fix all tests to work with new inheritance-based architecture
- Update AI instructions to reflect new architecture
